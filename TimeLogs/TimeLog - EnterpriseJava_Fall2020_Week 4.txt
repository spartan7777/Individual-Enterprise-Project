Enterprise Java Fall 2020: Weekly Reflection - Time Logs


Week 4
9/16/2020 - 9/23/2020 - 8 hours

Tasks Completed:
Completed most of the outstanding Week 2 assignments
Completed most of the Week 3 assignments
Watched All Week 3 Videos
Completed the Checkpoint 1 Materials for the Individual project
Continued to document the project plan


Accomplishments:  
I was able to put some assignments behind me and the practice and reading done for those older assignments. I did work more on the thought process on how I will create my presentation and I also had time to try to work on more of the HTML for my individual project. I was able to complete what I felt were good user stories for the project as well as begin to work on some drafts for screen shots for the application. 


Struggles:  
My struggles remain time and pace related as I still struggle with these medical issues that might require surgery. I am a little nervous about that. I fell a bit behind as I predicted and missed a class - and a chance to walk through some of the issues I had with the pom.xml file and other things from the assignments. I guess these will be handled by me at some point in a Q&A. 


Next Week Plan:
Since falling a bit behind, I have no choice but to put my head down and grind out what is left and what is coming ahead. I may have already begin the bad idea of falling behind. I will still not dwell too much on that and remain upbeat about the challenges ahead of me as I work to remain involved and engaged in this class. I will try to get all Week 2 and Week 3 materials done and turned in or close to ready for submission so that any time needed to complete them will be minimal. The main goal is to get ready for the next week as if it is a new week.
