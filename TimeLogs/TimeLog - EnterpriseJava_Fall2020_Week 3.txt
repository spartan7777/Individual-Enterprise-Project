Enterprise Java Fall 2020: Weekly Reflection - Time Logs


Week 3
9/10/2020 - 9/16/2020 - 6 hours

Tasks Completed:
Watched All Week 3 Videos
Completed the pitch and the idea for the Individual Project
Completed the pitch for the Professional Development Activity
Started documenting the project plan
Started thinking on Professional Development Activity presentation


Accomplishments:  
I have solidified my idea for the Individual project. After verification of my Professional Development Activity with the instructor I have full clarity on what I am going to move forward with on that front. Amazon's Lumberyard game engine. This should be a refreshing idea to tackle as it allows me to look into something ore that I don’t not know much about, in an area where I have some interest. 


Struggles:  
Missed a class. My struggles became time related as some new medical issues have kept me from being able to sit at my desk and work. What time I had that I was not in pain were used to try to get some of this work done. I did work through the thought process on how I will create my presentation and make things entertaining for everyone. I also had time to try to think on the actual building process for this application. I am comfortable with HTML (who isn’t), but I worry that I will struggle with how to "java it up". However, I am confident that this will come with research and hard questions. 


Next Week Plan:
I may have already begin the bad idea of falling behind. That said, I will try not to dwell too much on that and remain upbeat about the challenges ahead of me as I work to remain involved and engaged in this class. I will try to get all Week 2 and Week 3 materials done and turned in or close to ready for submission so that any time needed to complete them will be minimal.
