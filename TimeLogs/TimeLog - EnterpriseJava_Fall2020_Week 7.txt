Enterprise Java Fall 2020: Weekly Reflection - Time Logs


Week 7
10/8/2020 - 10/14/2020 - 4 hours

RELEVANT ITEMS:
1. Continued work to define the HTML files for the Individual Project.
2. Completed a pre-class scrum with the instructor to lay out where I am behind, my work plan, and what is expected going forward. 


ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  
I was not as productive this week. I was able to do a little more in regard to HTML page updates and revisions for my Individual Project. I was able to complete an impromptu pre-class scrum with the instructor where I was able to lay out my fears and concerns as I am behind by quite a bit and need an efficient way to catch up. I want to be sure that while I am trying to do all of the required work, I am also learning and implementing the concepts this class is setting out to impart.


SETBACKS:
My medical issues were once again an issue this week. It took time away from my ability to sit up and watch videos, and get my work done for this week. 


NEXT WEEK'S PLAN:
Next week will be devoted to catching up as much as possible once again. I need to complete the assignments for Week 4, 5, 6 and 7 as soon as possible. Then, I need to get right into my Individual Project and get as much done as I can to present a proper amount for work for the Individual Project Checkpoint 2. I would like to try and see if I can do a bit more on my Professional Development Activity as well.
